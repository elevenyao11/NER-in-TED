## Annotation Materials

### 1. Annotation Guidelines

This document explains the annotation guidelines for workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk. The preliminary named entity annotation is done by spaCy, so AMT workers will work on correcting the automatically-generated labels.

#### 1.1 **Task**

Decide whether the label is correct or not for the given entity. Each entity is in bold, and it is surrounded by a short context. If it is not correct, please choose the entity that you think would be the best fit.

For example,

```
... Since I was younger, I have been using **iPhone** because I love the design ...

Label: **PRODUCT**

```

The correct answer is **YES**, since **iPhone** is a product.

#### 1.2 **Label Descriptions**

### 2. Mechanical Turk Setup

The actual page of Mechanical Turk Sandbox that will be given to annotators is as below. The html file is uploaded in the [repo](https://github.ubc.ca/iameleve/COLX_523_Group2/blob/master/annotation/mturk_layout.html) as well.

### 3. A CSV file for uploading to Mechanical Turk

The csv file that will be published to AMT is as below. The actual file is uploaded in the [repo](https://github.ubc.ca/iameleve/COLX_523_Group2/blob/master/annotation/mturk_case_study.csv). It contains 41 examples. Also, the code for generating the csv file is in this [link](https://github.ubc.ca/iameleve/COLX_523_Group2/blob/master/src/NE_Annotation_for_MTurk.ipynb).
