#### Observations and discussion

As it is listed in the above table the number of tokens of TED Talk corpus is in the range of corporas from NLTK (100676 to 2621613).

TED Talks has the highest vocabulary size. A few reasons for that is:

- TED Talks are given by significan personsonalities (mostly highly educated) around the world whose work are worth sharing so the domain of vocabulary used is large.

- The presenters are comming from different backgrounds (science, engineering, art, activism, etc.) as a result specialty words (technical, scientific ...) words are in the talks as well as common words.


Analysis on the TED Talk corpus showed that:

Average number of words per talk is: 2027.29

Average number of words per pragraph is: 72.12
