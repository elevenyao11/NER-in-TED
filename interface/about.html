			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
		</center>
		<p>In this project, we built a Multilingual TED parallel corpus with the named entity annotation.
			The corpus is a collection of transcripts from TED videos including TEDx talks and TED-Ed across
			all genres, aiming to collect the transcripts in three different languages (English, Korean, and
			Chinese (simplified)). For automatic named entity extraction, we applied an English and Chinese
			model from spaCy, then we published our annotations to Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to improve
			the quality of the annotations (Krippendorf's alpha score of 0.7348).
